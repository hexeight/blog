Hello, I'm Omkar. I enjoy building things and speaking about it. I have helped design and develop enterprise facing Analytics, Blockchain and IOT solutions running on Azure and AWS. At the time of writing I am helping build a low-code Cloud Governance platform at Rapid Circle.

I speak at tech conferences in and around Pune. I love talking about IOT, Federation and sometimes Machine Learning.
