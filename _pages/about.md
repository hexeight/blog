Hello, I'm Omkar. I enjoy building things and speaking about them. I have helped design and develop enterprise facing Analytics, Blockchain and IOT solutions running on Azure and AWS. At the time of writing I am helping build a low-code Cloud Governance platform at Rapid Circle. I speak at tech conferences in and around Pune. I love talking about IOT, Federation and sometimes Machine Learning.

I have built an IOT startup that folded after a 3 year run in 2014. That brought me to Rapid Circle in the pursuit of learning what it takes to build a successful technology company. Since then I have been enjoying working with customers across domains like telecom, travel and health care; helping them find solutions that fit their needs.
